Sodium suggests possible environmental contamination or contamination with a sodium based product. High Aluminium evident indicating possible bearing/casing wear or Aluminium based grease source. The levels of Iron and Chromium appear high and suggest wear of a pump and/ or hydraulic rods/pistons. High ferrous debris result suggesting an abnormal wear process (large particles). The level of Manganese is higher than expected and may indicate the removal of anti-wear or an anti-corrossion type coating. Action should be taken to correct - Consider fluid change and/or filter change. Additionally consider check unit for abnormal noise or vibration & feedback inspection findings. Too much debris to give reliable ISO cleanliness code. Please confirm fluid brand and grade to ensure the diagnosis is relevant to this sample.
